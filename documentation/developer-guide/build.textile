h1. Building UML Designer

Youâ€™ll need Apache Maven 3 to be installed on your computer.
To launch the build, go to the root of your git repository and type :

@mvn clean package@

Maven will bootstrap itself, download all the dependencies and build UML Designer. The output of the build is a p2 repository (an update site) generated here :

@features/org.obeonetwork.dsl.uml2.update/target/repository@

To install it in an Eclipse installation use Help/Install New Software and point to this location.

Launching the test is not harder, just type :

@mvn clean verify@

Maven will launch the tests and give you the result. 
Code coverage is captured thanks to Jacoco.
