h1. Get the source code

This UML modeling environment is based on the "Sirius":https://www.eclipse.org/sirius. It is under an
Open Source license (*EPL*) and the source code is hosted on "github":https://github.com/ObeoNetwork/UML-Designer. 
It is intended to cover most use cases behind the usage of UML, and more importantly to be reused when you apply a 
model driven approach which uses both *UML and some DSL*. Everything should integrate seamlessly  in the same environment.
