h2. Environment

The UML Designer's documentation is hosted on Github: "https://github.com/ObeoNetwork/UML-Designer/tree/master/documentation":https://github.com/ObeoNetwork/UML-Designer/tree/master/documentation.

The documentation is built with "Jekyll":http://jekyllrb.com/.

All the documentation is written with the "textile":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile_(markup_language) syntax, in order that it is really easy to contribute.

h2. Global structure

The documentation structure is defined in the "pages.yml":https://github.com/ObeoNetwork/UML-Designer/blob/master/documentation/_data/pages.yml file.

{% highlight YAML %}
- title: Overview
  file: overview

- title: Download
  file: download

- category: Tutorials
  pages:
  - title: Getting started
    file: tutorials/tuto-getting-started
  - title: Create project
    file: tutorials/tuto-create-project
...
{% endhighlight %}

@- title: xxx@ and  @- category: xxx@ generate a menu in the main web site navbar.

To create a menu which reference an anchor in an existing page use the syntax :
{% highlight YAML %}
- category: MyCategory
  pages:
  - title: MyTitle
    file: path/filename
    anchor: MyAnchor
{% endhighlight %}

Have a look the section below to see how to define an anchor in a page.

h2. Page

Each defined page starts with : 
{% highlight YAML %}
---
layout: article
title: MyTitle
subtitle: MySubTitle
relativePath: ..
---
{% endhighlight %}

This allows to set the different variables. 
All the pages reused the same includes : "https://github.com/ObeoNetwork/UML-Designer/tree/master/documentation/_includes":https://github.com/ObeoNetwork/UML-Designer/tree/master/documentation/_includes
And the available layouts are defined in the _layouts folder: "https://github.com/ObeoNetwork/UML-Designer/tree/master/documentation/_layouts":https://github.com/ObeoNetwork/UML-Designer/tree/master/documentation/_layouts

The rest of the page, defines the main content. To edit the page content use the "textile":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile_(markup_language) syntax. 

Use the following syntax to :
* Define an anchor in the page named _MyPage_ and defined in the folder _path_ : @h1(#MyAnchor). My title@
* Reference an anchor : @{{ page.relativePath }}/path/MyPage.html#MyAnchor@

h2. Build the documentation

To build the documentation, commit the changes in the Eclipse Help content and update the web-site a shell script is available in :
@documentation/gen-doc.sh@

When you want to update the documentation :
* Update the textile files
* Launch the script from the git repository root :
./documentation/gen-doc.sh "My commit message"

The script automatically:
* generate the static web-site
* copy the result into the Eclipse help content
* copy the result into the gh-pages

_In the future all this actions will be done automatically by the continuous integration build._

The different steps done by the script are explained below.

h3. Build the web-site

Go to @UML-Designer/documentation@ folder in your local repo.
And launch : @jekyll build@
This operation will generate a new @_site@ folder containing all the @.html@ files generated from the textile files.

To update the online web-site, just copy/paste the content of the _site folder to the gh-pages branch on the repo. Commit and push the new version of the web-site.

The new web site will be available immediately on : "http://obeonetwork.github.io/UML-Designer/":http://obeonetwork.github.io/UML-Designer/

h3. Integrate the documentation to Eclipse

We integrate the web site inside Eclipse as embedded documentation for UML Designer. We just defined an Eclipse specific "toc.xml":https://github.com/ObeoNetwork/UML-Designer/blob/master/documentation/toc.xml file which will be used to integrate the website content into the Eclipse Help Content.

When the textile files have been updated, the web-site must be re-generated as presented in the previous section. Then update the @toc.xml@ and copy the content of the @_site@ folder to @UML-Designer/plugins/org.obeonetwork.dsl.uml2.design.doc/html@.
