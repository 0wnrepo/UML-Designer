h1. Creating Elements

All the elements you can create in a deployment diagram are available through the *palette*.

You also have the ability to create elements in a contextual way related to the currently selected elements.
If your pointer is on the diagram background, after a few seconds you should see the following assistant :

If your pointer is *on a node* the assistant will be :

In deed, a node is a composite element.

h1. Editing labels

We added a few accelerators so that you can quickly edit *labels* on elements or edges just by typing. Typing : 
* @aNewName@ will update the label.

h1. Artifact deployment

We have two way to deploy an artifact:
* Deployment could be shown as a deploy dependency that is drawn from the artifact to the deployment target.
* Deployment could also be shown with deployed artifacts contained by a deployment target.
