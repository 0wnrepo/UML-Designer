h1. Use cases with or without subjects

The *Use Case Diagram* will display any @UseCase@ not being affected to a subject on the canvas. If a subject is affected, then the use case
will be displayed directly within this subject.

Dragging a use case from a subject to the canvas (and the other way around) will set or unset the subject accordingly.
