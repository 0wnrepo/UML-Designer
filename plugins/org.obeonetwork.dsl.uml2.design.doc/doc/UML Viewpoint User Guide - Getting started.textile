h1. Getting Started

This section describes how to start using the UML designer either from existing UML models or by creating a new one.

h2. Starting from the Travel Agency example

Import the TravelAgency project using the menu @File/New/Example...@.

!gettingStarted/example-1-menu.png!

Pick the *Travel Agency UML* wizard and click on @Next@ and then @Finish@.

!gettingStarted/example-2-wizard.png!

Click Finish on the wizard and a *TravelAgency* project appears in your workspace.

Double-click on the *agency.aird* file (or right click and @Open Session@), you will be greeted with the main package hierarchy diagram.

From here you can navigate to existing diagrams by right clicking on the *Model*.


h2. Create a new UML model & session file

To create a new UML model and an associated designer session, open the wizard through the menu __File > New > Other...__ and select the __UML Model__ item through the category __Viewpoint > Modeler__.

You can choose specific name and location for the UML & designer session files on the next wizard pages. When you press the __Finish__ button, the <a href="#vpselection">viewpoint selection</a> dialog shows up.
Once the __UML Structural viewpoint__ is selected, a new editor opens on the root package hierarchy diagram showing only the root package.

Now you can right click on the displayed package to create all the available diagrams or use the palette to create the package structure that fits to your needs.

h2. Display & edit an existing UML model

To create a new UML design on existing UML models, simply drag & drop the root UML model to handle into the __Model Content__ view.
Then a wizard will show up asking you to create a new session. Follow the step upon the <a href="#vpselection">viewpoint selection</a> dialog.
Once the __UML Structural viewpoint__ is selected, a new editor opens on the root package hierarchy diagram showing the existing package structure of your model.

h2(#vpselection). UML designer viewpoints

Two viewpoints are specified on the UML designer each bringing the following views:
* UML Structural modeling
** Package hierarchy diagram
** Class diagram
** Component diagram
** Object diagram
** Composite diagram
** Related classes diagram
* UML Behavioral modeling
** State machine diagram
** Activity diagram
** Use case diagram
** Sequence diagram

!gettingStarted/UMLViewpointSelection.PNG!

You can select either viewpoints or both depending on your use case. Note that the __Package hierarchy diagram__ is the entry point to create new diagrams such as Activity or Sequence diagrams. So it is advised to select at least the __UML Structural modeling__ viewpoint.
